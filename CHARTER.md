# SOC Infrastructure Horizontal Committee Charter

The objective of the SoC HC is to identify high priority gaps in RISC-V technology (HW and/or SW) portfolio to build SoCs targeting various industry segments from embedded to datacenter and beyond. SoC HC aims to define right system level HW/SW contract to enable these technologies.

The SoC HC will work collaboratively with other HCs, SIGs and TGs that are already working on addressing these gaps or are chartered to work on the domain in which the gap exists. 

Where unaddressed gaps exist, the HC will form SIGs to define the strategy for addressing the gaps and use the recommendation of the SIGs to form TGs to define ISA/Non-ISA specs where appropriate and to define guidelines/requirements specifications where defining a ISA/Non-ISA specification not appropriate.

By its nature, SoC HC will overlap in topic areas with other committees and some topics will be direct line and some will be dotted line in a matrixed fashion. 

The Goal of SoC is prioritize the work and try to expedite the work. The SoC HC will track development milestones, deliverables, help find resources and breakdown barriers/roadblocks for the SIG and TGs it sponsors.
